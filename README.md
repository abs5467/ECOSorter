## Introduction
I participated in the Metropolitan Engineering Competition at Toronto Metropolitan University (TMU) in the Innovative Design Category by developing EcoSorter, an automated waste-sorting system, in a team of 6 members. The 6 members included students of multiple engineering disciplines, such as computer, electrical, aerospace, and biomedical. We worked together to bring a physical prototype, some technical components, like a code written in Python, and a 20-minute slideshow presentation. Out of 11 teams, our team secured 4th place, showcasing our innovative approach and hard work.

## Background
From our research, we see that Toronto produces nearly 830,000 tonnes of waste annually, with a diversion rate of about 48.6%, meaning over half of the city's waste still ends up in landfills. A significant portion of this waste is misplaced, with 77% of materials in large city garbage bins being incorrectly discarded. Most of Toronto's waste is sent to the Green Lane Landfill, which could reach full capacity by 2034-2035. Given this, we decided to design EcoSorter.

Unlike standard trash cans, EcoSorter offers an innovative automated sorting system, making waste disposal more efficient. Compared to other automated trash can models, like Russia's limited public automated trash cans and Pan Am's time-consuming sorting, which also requires human assistance, EcoSorter allows for quick, automated waste disposal for not only the public but for households as well.
